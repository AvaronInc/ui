Avaron
Decentralized. Intelligent. Infrastructure that defends itself.

**What is Avaron?**
Avaron is a fully integrated, open-source platform that combines cybersecurity, network automation, identity management, and storage into a single decentralized system. It replaces the fragmented tools of modern IT with a unified, AI-driven infrastructure that can detect, respond, adapt, and heal in real time.

Built for Enterprises, MSPs, and security-first organizations who are tired of managing chaos.

**Core Capabilities**
AI-Powered SD-WAN
Backed by VPP with WireGuard, microsegmentation, and dynamic policy routing.

**VaultID Identity System**
Quantum-resistant, biometric MFA for users and devices with decentralized quorum-based verification.

**NestVault Immutable Storage**
MinIO-powered with 4+2 erasure coding, delta-synced to Wasabi hot cloud.

**Reactive AI Monitoring**
Built-in log, traffic, and endpoint analysis using Mixtral + Weaviate, Wazuh, and Arkime.

**Self-Healing Cluster Design**
Requires three nodes; if one fails, the other two instantly take over.

**Pre-Deployment Testing Sandbox**
AI-simulated change testing environment with impact scoring and audit trails.

**Multi-Tenant Architecture**
Isolated service containers, scoped dashboards, role-based access â€” ideal for MSPs or complex orgs.

**Technical Foundation**
Alpine Linux containers

Docker Swarm/Kubernetes orchestration

TypeScript frontend (built in Lovable.dev)

Go-based backend tools and CLI

All APIs and UI components are open source (AGPLv3)

Device deployment protected by defensive patents

ðŸ”’ Legal Protections
The hardware deployment model and identity infrastructure are protected by defensive patents.
